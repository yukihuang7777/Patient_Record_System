# Patient Record System

## Proposal

A patient record application for healthcare professionals in hospitals. 
It allows you to create a personal information for all patients who visit the hospital. 
Possible features include:
- the urgency of the patient's situation; 
- information about patients who have already seen the hospital;
- recording patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time.

I am interested in this program because with this system, healthcare professionals can quickly understand
*the severity of each patient's situation* and develop **the most reasonable plan**.
