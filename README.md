# Patient Record System

## Proposal

A patient record application for *healthcare professionals in hospitals*. 
It allows you to *create a personal information for all patients* who visit the hospital. 
Possible features include information about *patients who have already seen the hospital*; 
*recording patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time*; 
*showing a roster of patient's information*.
I am interested in this program because with this system, healthcare professionals can quickly understand
**the severity of each patient's situation** and develop **the most reasonable plan**.
